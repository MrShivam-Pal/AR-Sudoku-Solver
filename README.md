# AR-Sudoku-Solver/Realtime Sudoku Solver

## Introduction
This project is a Realtime Sudoku Solver that utilizes computer vision techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize and solve Sudoku puzzles in real time. The application captures a live video feed of a Sudoku puzzle, processes the image using computer vision algorithms to detect the grid and extract the digits, and then employs a CNN model to recognize and solve the puzzle.

## Features

ðŸ‘‰ Realtime Sudoku Recognition: Capture live video feed of a Sudoku puzzle and recognize the digits in real time.

ðŸ‘‰ Computer Vision Grid Detection: Automatically detect the grid structure of the Sudoku puzzle using computer vision techniques.

ðŸ‘‰ CNN Digit Recognition: Utilize a trained CNN model to recognize and classify the digits extracted from the Sudoku grid.

ðŸ‘‰ Realtime Solution Display: Display the solution to the Sudoku puzzle in real time, overlaid on the video feed.
